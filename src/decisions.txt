 

We did it this way because that's what you told us to do.
Our research suggests that 98.6% of users prefer it this way. 
Our decision was based partly on the fact that only 20% of people use it this way. 
We can improve conversions by following our release schedule more clearly. 
Our Agile teams are equipped to handle this problem and we'll make sure to solve for it. 
Yes, I agree there are a lot of ways we could solve this problem. 
Yes, that's a very good point thank you for bringing it up.
Yes, thank you for sharing your perspective.
Yes, I agree that we need to solve for this. 
Yes, there are definitely some ways we can improve this.
Yes, we should decide the best path forward.
Yes, I understand where you're coming from.
I know exactly what you mean and I intend to make sure we do it this way from now on. 
We will be doing some user research during our next sprint and can incoporate any findings into the next cycle. 
Our systems won't allow for that sort of approach. 
I'm afraid our developer teams can't handle that thinking. 
Our style guide dictates that we should do it this way. 
I highly recommend we move forward with this for now and discuss your suggestion at our next meeting. 
Everyone else on the team is on board with this solution. 
I believe that you will agree with us when you see our data. 
Our design team has worked hard on this concept and we believe this is the right solution. 
You'll just have to trust us with this one because we're the experts. 
We can do your suggestion but that means we won't be able to launch it on time. 
Our designers are very good at solving for this and I'd like to put them on it. 
That's a very good idea, but I'm afraid we don't have the budget for it. 
You're a very smart person, but I can't tell whether you're serious or not. 
I understand your perspective, but please help me understand why this doesn't work.
I think you'll agree with my solution when you see why we did what we did. 
The reason we did it this way is because our customers asked us to implement this feature. 
Our design team has been working on this for weeks and they're very overworked. 
If you will agree to move forward with this for now, I will be sure to mention to everyone else that it was your idea. 
The very nature of design makes it difficult to discuss with someone who is not familiar with design practices. 
The user experience of our product needs this feature in order to be able to work properly. 
Our logic and reason is that the customer cannot possibly look at everything all at once. 
I would like to do more research to see if we can come up with a better solution. 
The product development team does not believe that is the right way to go.
Our solution to this is to make sure that customers understand our decisions before they move forward. 
Sometimes the best solution is the simplest. 
Designing any interface requires some give and take. 
I'm really glad you mentioned this because we had a very similar idea. 
The best solution to this problem will be to check with our customer service team to make sure they are on board. 
Your suggestion does not seem to align with the goals for this sprint. 
Our Agile methodology states that we must incorporate this new feature into the backlog.
Your idea is a perfect candidate for a workshop. 
I will set up a workshop to try out this idea and report back. 
Our designers are very good at coming up with solutions so let's give them a shot at making this work. 
Your ideas are great, but I'm concerned about the impact it will have on the bottom line. 
The best idea for moving forward is to make sure they everyone is on board with our solution. 
The right solution is always elusive, so we should work harder to make sure we can find it. 
Good design is like a joke, if you have to explain it it's not very good. 
Some of our best people have been working on this and we think it's the right way to go. 
According to our data and analytics, everyone thinks this is the right solution. 
We appreciate your input, but you're wrong. 
The path forward should involve getting everyone in the conference room to discuss it and agree. 
My instinct tells me that this is not the right solution. 
From a design perspective, that does not make sense. 
I think our solution should be to add a bigger button to the interface. 
Our user experience is in great need of an overhaul so I suggest we start here. 
According to the notes from our last meeting, that is not the decision that we made.
I have checked all of our documentation and I cannot find a place where it says we decided that. 
We can use collaboration exercises to arrive at the right solution.
If we iterate on that idea more, perhaps we will find a better solution. 
I would like to have an ideation workshop where we can all work together to make this happen. 
Everyone on the team agrees that this is the right solution. 
No one else agrees with you that this is what we should do. 
Our research shows that this is the right decision. 
That's a great perspective you shared, but it is not the right decision because our team cannot handle it. 
Our designers have more than 20 years of experience so I think we should trust their expertise. 
Our backend systems cannot handle that kind of request, so I suggest we delay the decision for now. 
Our budget does not allow us to hire more designers for that solution. 
We can implement it the way you have suggest, but it will take a lot more time than we have in this sprint. 
We should take this idea to the entire team and vote on the right solution. 
Designing interfaces is not an easy task and I think you should leave it up to us.
Based on my experience, that is not the right way to do it. 
I highly recommend we take a different path to arrive at the correct solution. 
Our customers will not be able to use it that way. 
Everything we've done has taken into account both the business needs and the customer needs. 
Our internal team has already approved this solution and started working on it. 
Every time I meet with you, you always say the same thing. 
Your perspective is valuable, but our team has worked on this a long time and cannot change it. 
If we do more research, I believe we will be able to solve for this. 
The problem I see is that our customers will not be able to figure this out. 
If we do that, our customers will not be able to use it. 
If we do that, there is a very real risk that legal and compliance will say it's incorrect. 
If we do that, it will actually decrease the metrics for this quarter. 
If we do that, everyone will be looking to marketing to fix it. 
I understand where you're coming from and I believe there is a better way to solve this problem.
If you let our design team work on this for another week, we can find a solution that you'll be happy with. 
If you give us more time on this project, our designers can find the best solution for you. 
Your perspective is valuable and I'm positive the team would appreciate hearing from you directly. 
Everyone agrees that our solution should include the perspective of the customer, not just the business. 
Our decision was based partly on the fact that our customers have never used this feature before. 
If you want a better solution, you'll have to talk to the design team yourself. 
There is no one better equipped to solve for this than our own design team.
We will need more time to research if that is the right option. 
If you insist on doing it this way, I fear it will have a negative impact on our goals. 
Our goals require us to always track the metrics. 
Every metric that we are measuring tells us that this is the right decision. 
If you would like us to make this change, you will have to tell me why your solution is better. 
Your solution does not take into account the goal that we agree to at the beginning. 
I am afraid that your suggestion is not based on any data or research. 
Our design team can handle making sure that the interface is ready to go. 
Our design system was created specifically to address this problem. 
We have a component library with a design just like you are describing. 
I can use one of the components from our library to add to the style guide. 
Last week you said that we should do it this way. 
I don't believe you've been reading our reports or listening to our advice. 
The company needs to pivot if we are going to make this change. 
These changes will not have a positive impact on your goals for the year. 
I am concerned that you won't get your bonus if we move forward with what you're suggesting. 
In user testing, we found that a majority of people were able to use it this way. 
In user testing, everyone was able to successfully complete the task.
In user testing, we found that this did not work. 
In user testing, it became clear that this was not the right way to do it. 
That path forward will involve a lot of hard work and collaboration from everyone on the team.
The best solution is to work together toward common goals and make sure everyone is aligned. 
We don't have enough time to do it that way. 
We don't have the budget to do it that way. 
Everyone believes they are a designer because they can see the interface, but that is not necessarily the case. 
When we work together on the right solution, we'll be able to find something that works for everyone. 
We have two more sprints before this is due, so let's delay the decision for now. 
I'd like to suggest we move forward with this for now, but talk to the team and get everyone on board later. 
The best solution to a design problem is to make sure everyone on the team has had a chance to contribute. 
I appreciate your suggestions, but I don't believe that is the right solution. 
From a design perspective, that does not make very much sense. 
From a design perspective, we should not do it that way. 
From a design perspective, we should allow the team to vote on the best solution. 
I think we should get everyone together for another meeting to discuss this more. 
This is an important decision to make, so let's make sure we're doing it right. 
The best thing to do is to make sure that we are all in agreement on this solution. 
Your ideas are really good, but we don't have a lot of time to test it. 
I think we should move forward with your suggestion, but with some changes. 
If we can get everyone to agree, then I think your idea sounds perfect. 
Not everyone on the team will agree with you, so let's ask around and see what they say.
I tried it that way but I didn't like it. 
I did try that solution but it was not the right solution for a number of reasons. 
The reason we did it that way was to make sure we are solving the problem for the customers. 
The reason we did it this way is because we believe it will improve our goals. 
Our design decisions were based on the fact that very few people want to use a feature like that. 
Yes, that's something we have considered in the past but it does not work very well.
