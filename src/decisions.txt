By embracing behavior change in our customers, we create new paths for sustainability in the industry.
Our use of color and negative space assists the user in getting from point A to point B. 
We need our users to look from top to bottom and left to right. 
A flexible design pattern requires that our component library support cognitive bias overload.
The performance of the system depends wholly on whether the user is able to finish the task.
Cognitive bias is the surest way to deliver the outcome we design for our sprint.
The interface is approachable for users seeking to diversify their cohesive experience.
To achieve this disruptive design, we spent weeks studying the various assumptions that affect our bias.
Our interaction designs are seamless, timely, engaging, and delightful. 
Our design sprints create collaborative opportunities for customers to engage with our platform on-demand.
The reusability of this library simplifies the nature of our design process and opens opportunities for transparency.
A useful and usable UX solution should consider the context of the user's conversational UI.
Providing feedback to our customers is a critical component to leveraging disruptive design techniques at scale.
Our solution will scale because it is designed to be flexible with market conditions.
We've avoided the use of dark patterns to avoid the ethical questions of design latency.
The user's cognitive load must be considered by everyone on the team to ensure we deliver the right paradigm.
The information architecture of our platform assists in creating an environment for workshop exercises. 
Keep in mind that a majority of our users desire to interact with our systems with a cohesive experience.
All of our customers are excited about this feature, so we should consider putting it into production.
Everyone on our team is in agreement that this is the right solution. 
When we create design solutions, we only choose the very best user experiences.

We cannot afford to not do it this way.
Our design decisions are the best because we put a lot of time and effort into it. 
Everyone on our team went to art school, so they are qualified to make these design decisions.
Design will need a seat at the table if we are to be expected to have this much influence in the company.
Not every design is the right choice, which is why I've created several alternatives for you to consider. 
Our customers demand that we release this design as-is. 
Design is not easy. Please trust us to do our jobs.
We have a solid UX strategy for solving all of these issues.
I can't explain to you why this solution is the best. You will have to trust me.
After a lot of discussion, our team arrived at the solution you see.
It's not necessary to question our expertise on design.
This is one of the most innovative design solutions you've ever seen.
We use a special form of innovative thinking in our design process.
This design is sexy, fluid, and ready to go viral.
With this design, your business will go viral in a matter of hours. 
With this design, no one will be able to stop us from overtaking our competition.
This design is better than anything that Apple could have done.
We make all of the best design decisions because we are trained to understand our users. 
The results of our A/B test clearly showed that this design is the winner.
Our A/B testing platform was instrumental in helping us choose the right design for this project.
In our sprint planning, we identified several key areas that we should focus on.
Our backlog is filled with dozens of ideas for how to solve this and we arrived at this one.
We created a customer journey map and that allowed us to arrive at the right solution.
Our customer journey does not align with the goals of the business, so we re-designed it.
I created an empathy map of our customers and this is the result. 
We designed this by having a lot of empathy for our customers and how they use the product.
Our team spent two weeks doing empathy exercises to really get in minds of our customers. 
With a little more time, we will be able to find the perfect design solution to this problem.
There are no bad ideas, that's why we'd like to invite you to come to our brainstorming session.
Good ideas can come from anywhere and this idea came from our research.
We've run qualitative analysis on this user flow and discovered a flaw in the way we lead users down the path.
The animations allow the user to feel some emotion when they use it.
Our best designers have come up with this solution to your business problems.
You're going to love everything I have to show you today.
Our decisions are based on facts and reason, not only pretty pictures. 
We still need to do some additional testing, but I believe this solution is your best choice.
Our business metrics will not improve until we implement these features in this way.
There are a number of ways to solve this problem, but our solution considers the most use cases.
We considered a variety of approaches, but believe this design to be the absolute best option for you.
We know you have an opinion on this, but we'd like you to support our decision even if you disagree.
We did it this way because that's what you told us to do.
Our research suggests that 98.6% of users prefer it this way. 
Our decision was based partly on the fact that only 20% of people use it this way. 
We recommend this design because it was vetted by professionals in the industry who know what they're talking about.
From a design perspective, our decisions are based on reason and logic.
We can improve conversions by following our release schedule more clearly. 
Our Agile teams are equipped to handle this problem and we'll make sure to solve for it. 
We will be doing some user research during our next sprint and can incorporate any findings into the next cycle. 
Our systems won't allow for that sort of approach. 
Our style guide dictates that we should do it this way. 
I highly recommend we move forward with this for now and discuss your suggestion at our next meeting. 
Everyone else on the team is on board with this solution. 
I believe that you will agree with us when you see our data. 
Our design team has worked hard on this concept and we believe this is the right solution. 
You'll just have to trust us with this one because we're the experts. 
We can do your suggestion but that means we won't be able to launch it on time. 
Our designers are very good at solving for this and I'd like to put them on it. 
I think you'll agree with my solution when you see why we did what we did. 
The reason we did it this way is because our customers asked us to implement this feature. 
Our design team has been working on this for weeks. 
If you will agree to move forward with this for now, I will be sure to mention to everyone else that it was your idea. 
The very nature of design makes it difficult to discuss with someone who is not familiar with design practices. 
The user experience of our product needs this feature in order to be able to work properly. 
Our logic and reason is that the customer cannot possibly look at everything all at once. 
I would like to do more research to see if we can come up with a better solution. 
The product development team does not believe that is the right way to go.
Our solution to this is to make sure that customers understand our decisions before they move forward. 
Sometimes the best solution is the simplest. 
Designing any interface requires some give and take. 
The best solution to this problem will be to check with our customer service team to make sure they are on board. 
Our Agile methodology states that we must incorporate this new feature into the backlog.
I will set up a workshop to try out this idea. 
Our designers are very good at coming up with solutions so let's give them a shot at making this work. 
The best idea for moving forward is to make sure they everyone is on board with our solution. 
The right solution is always elusive, so we should work harder to make sure we can find it. 
Good design is like a joke, if you have to explain it it's not very good. 
Some of our best people have been working on this and we think it's the right way to go. 
According to our data and analytics, everyone thinks this is the right solution. 
The path forward should involve getting everyone in the conference room to discuss it and agree. 
My instinct tells me that this is the right solution. 
From a design perspective, that does not make sense.  
Our user experience is in great need of an overhaul so I suggest we start here. 
We use collaboration exercises to arrive at the right solution.
If we iterate on that idea more, perhaps we will find a better solution. 
I would like to have an ideation workshop where we can all work together to make this happen. 
Everyone on the team agrees that this is the right solution. 
Our research shows that this is the right decision. 
Our designers have more than 20 years of experience so I think we should trust their expertise. 
Designing interfaces is not an easy task and I think you should leave it up to us.
Based on my experience, this is the right way to do it. 
I highly recommend we take a different path to arrive at the correct solution. 
Everything we've done has taken into account both the business needs and the customer needs. 
Our internal team has already approved this solution and started working on it. 
If we do more research, I believe we will be able to solve for this. 
If you let our design team work on this for another week, we can find a solution that you'll be happy with. 
If you give us more time on this project, our designers can find the best solution for you. 
Everyone agrees that our solution should include the perspective of the customer, not just the business. 
Our decision was based partly on the fact that our customers have never used this feature before. 
There is no one better equipped to solve for this than our own design team.
We will need more time to research if that is the right option. 
Our goals require us to always track the metrics. 
Every metric that we are measuring tells us that this is the right decision. 
Our design team can handle making sure that the interface is ready to go. 
Our design system was created specifically to address this problem. 
The company needs to pivot if we are going to make this change. 
In user testing, we found that a majority of people were able to use it this way. 
In user testing, everyone was able to successfully complete the task.
In user testing, we found that this did not work. 
In user testing, it became clear that this was not the right way to do it. 
That path forward will involve a lot of hard work and collaboration from everyone on the team.
The best solution is to work together toward common goals and make sure everyone is aligned. 
Everyone believes they are a designer because they can see the interface, but that is not necessarily the case. 
When we work together on the right solution, we'll be able to find something that works for everyone. 
We have two more sprints before this is due, so let's delay the decision for now. 
I'd like to suggest we move forward with this for now, but talk to the team and get everyone on board later. 
The best solution to a design problem is to make sure everyone on the team has had a chance to contribute. 
From a design perspective, that does not make very much sense. 
From a design perspective, we should not do it that way. 
From a design perspective, we should allow the team to vote on the best solution. 
I think we should get everyone together for another meeting to discuss this more. 
This is an important decision to make, so let's make sure we're doing it right. 
The best thing to do is to make sure that we are all in agreement on this solution.  
The reason we did it that way was to make sure we are solving the problem for the customers. 
The reason we did it this way is because we believe it will improve our goals. 
Our design decisions were based on the fact that very few people want to use a feature like that. 
Our team is confident that this is the right decision to make. 
Our best guess is that the users will not be able to understand what you're suggesting. 
I spoke with our backend team and they are of the opinion that this idea will not work. 
Let's re-group and get the team together next week to decide. 
It's possible that the version you're seeing hasn't been updated with the latest designs. 
Please refresh your browser and empty the cache first. 
One option that will work is if we move the deadline back by several weeks. 
The challenge we have is that we don't have the resources necessary to support that. 
An Agile approach suggests that we do two week sprints and iterate frequently. 
The best way to approach this is going to be do a design thinking exercise. 
Our user journey map tells us that this is really the best decision. 
We originally decided that this user flow was the right choice for the business. 
There are a number of different ways we can solve this and that is one of them.
The simplest solution is usually the most obvious. 
Every decision we make has a clear rationale behind it.
Our customers need access to this and our team has been working non-stop to make sure it works.
There is a lot more to consider here than just your perspective. 
We have to make sure this is going to work for all use cases.
We need to make sure that our biases are not influencing this decision.
If we aren't careful, our own bias will cloud our judgement and we won't build the right thing. 
We need to be sure we're building the right thing and not just what we want to build. 
What matters the most is that we build something that will solve a problem for our customers.
I'd recommend that we ideate on this more in a workshop to find out if what we're doing it correct.
My advice is to double check everything by doing some user tests.
We have a design system to be sure that everything we design adheres to our companies brand guidelines.
Our style guide is intended to address this problem. 
I can find several design patterns in our style guide which would address your concerns. 
I think we need to discuss the wider implications of this change. 
This decision is based on data and I believe that is the right way to do it. 
If we organized a design thinking workshop, we might be able to come up with a better solution.
According to our brand guidelines, this is the right way to implement this part of the design.
This solution has already been approved by legal and marketing. 
We can do an A/B test to see which solution is the most effective. 
We are more concerned about what design is the most effective for our users than we are about what this group thinks. 
Our meetings should always be focused on making sure that the user remains at the center of the conversation.
As the experts on design, my team and I recommend this solution. 
We have expertise in this area and I'd like to ask that you trust us with this solution, even if you disagree.
We've put a lot of time and effort into trying to find the right solution for you.
Our customers are the most important consideration, so I suggest we take a minute to consider whether that's true.
We cannot make progress without your support to move forward with this solution. 
We do expect that our solution will fix the problem we're having with customers.
I read a book about design that suggested we do it this way.
Design is never complete, but we can always choose to stop and implement this for now.
I would like to move forward with this design. Please choose which one you prefer.
I like this design better and I think you should trust me.
You can clearly see which design is superior. Please give your approval.
I need you to choose the design that best suits your preferences.
By doing it this way, all of our customers will be able the finish their tasks on time.
Design is a hard skill to master, so please be patient while we discuss our decisions.
I'd like to walk you through all of our design decisions one at a time.
It's not possible to solve for all use cases, so we've narrowed our decision down to this one.
Every design we show you will demonstrate the value that our team brings to the company.
We need to make sure that everyone is aligned on the right way to solve for this.
When we met last week, you agreed that this was the right solution.
I'd like to suggest we postpone the decision until we can come up with a better solution for the business.
Everyone on our team agrees that making this decision will have a negative effect on conversion.
According to our documentation, this is not the decision that we made this time last week.
Every meeting we have delays our decision and prevents our team from being able to deliver on time. 
Please trust us with this solution. We think this is the right way to do.
It's true that it's risky making this change, but I believe it will help the user experience. 
The truth is, design is difficult to explain, but I hope you will bear with me while I talk through it.
Our designs cannot have the impact they need without your approval.
The key to creating the best design is to always make sure that the customer is the center of the process.
Our process is designed to eliminate bias from the conversation so we can arrive at the best possible design decisions.
Our job is to make sure the user remains at the center of the conversation.
In some ways, our decisions are intended to give the customer a sense of control over their data.
When we created this, our team had spent countless hours interviewing customers.
We have a lot of evidence that this is the best way to implement this. 
I will need to follow up with our brand experts to make sure that is compliant.
Every interface requires a certain amount of tradeoff with the design.
Our interfaces are intentionally designed to be easy to use for the customer.
We will need to do more research to understand if that's the case or not.
Using a Lean UX approach should help us find the right solution.
If we fill out this UX canvas, I'm sure we will find a way to agree with each other.
A white-boarding exercise might be the best way to flesh out all these ideas.
I'd suggest we do a design thinking workshop to really get the best from the design team.
We can always put this in the backlog and address it later. 
We should discuss this with the front-end developers and find out if they can do it. 
Our customers have never requested this feature before. 
We would like to implement this now and we can consider your suggestion for the next sprint.
One of our users said this was the most difficult interface they have ever used. 
We'd like to focus more on making sure that our users can complete their tasks on time. 
We have external research that indicates our design decisions will work. 
We did it this way because that's what everyone agreed was the correct approach.
When we implement this, we need to be sure we do enough research to check our assumptions. 
Every interface has difficult parts and this one is very challenging to overcome. 
I'm not sure who is responsible for making this decision, but I would like to move forward. 
The customer database requires extensive work if we are to do what you would like. 
When we launch this, I'd like to be sure that you are available for the release. 
Our design and development teams have put a lot of effort into finalizing this design.
We have support from everyone else on the team with this solution. 
Our decisions are based on industry-standard best practices.
This is a standard approach to human-computer interaction design.
Good design should be obvious and this solution is obviously not good.
I know good design when I see it.
If we are going to do Agile, I suggest against this proposal.
The best solution is the one that takes into account both the customer and the business needs.
All of our research points to this being the correct solution.
We should do a design sprint to really see if this makes the most sense. 
The best way to move forward is to ask everyone to vote on the solution that will improve our metrics.
The customer experience is critical to our success, so let's agree to disagree.
I have a lot of expertise in this area and I don't think this is what we should do.
It's always ideal to find some research to support your decisions if you want to get support.  
Our researchers have a lot of experiences understanding our customer's needs.
The business goals will have to be met and this design is the right solution.
We will be watching our analytics this week and can report back to you if anything changes.
It's possible that our designs for this part are based heavily on some assumptions about the customer. 
We have customer journey maps that indicate otherwise.
Our user journeys clearly demonstrate that this design is the best solution to this problem.
No matter what, we always have to make sure we are solving problems for our users.
We believe making this change will increase engagement across the board.
We might need to use eye tracking software to really understand how people are using it.
My whole team is at a conference next week so we will need to wait until after they get back.
Everyone believes their solution is right, but rarely do people really take into account the needs and expectations of users.
There are a lot of things we considered when designing this user experience and I'd like to explain them to you.
We have to take into account the needs and expectations of our customers first.
It's useful if we consider this from a design perspective. Our solution is the best.
We were motivated to help our users finish these tasks faster, that's why we did it this way.
A lot of thought and effort has gone into the designs you see today.
Our UX strategy for this design has informed all of our decisions from research to content.
In order to make this decision, we need to find the delta. 
We really think this design pops more than the last one.
Once we get the results back from our user research team, I can let you know. 
Everyone is excited to see this design in production, so let's agree that this solution will work for now.
You need to keep in mind that all of us on the design team are experts at our craft.
No matter what happens, we will make sure that everything gets fixed before it is put in production.
In every user study, we curate a list of the most commonly used features and this one was the winner. 
The results of our A/B text indicated that this was the right choice. 
Our design team spent weeks pouring over all the data and has come to the conclusion that this is the right choice. 
I think you'll understand when you see how our research impacted this design decision. 
We've collected dozens of stories from our customers to help us narrow the choices down to this.
Our design is intended to increase revenue. 
We did a design thinking exercise where each participant drew their suggestions and this is the result.
We started with divergent thinking and then brought everything together to arrive at this solution.
We believe this is the best solution for the customer because it gets them to their content faster.
Our style guide includes all the necessarily components to make this product successful.
The nature of design is that it's very subjective, but we are using brain science to identify our user's pain points.
Design can be fickle, but all of our solutions are based on solid scientific evidence.
Our corporate design standards allow the interface to use each one of these components.
We did a design sprint to come up with this UX solution.
Some of the brightest minds in our industry have recommended similar approaches. 
Our designs are so unique and innovative that every customer is going to love what we've done.
That's what the marketing department told us we had to do.
We were limited by what our branding guidelines allowed us to do.
Our solution is naturally limited by the technology we have available. 
We had to design it this way to accommodate the tech stack our dev team uses.
We tried to create something much more attractive, but there was not enough time to do so.
We used a Jobs To Be Done framework to help us make the decisions on this project. 
Most of our thinking is based purely on our own intuition.
We used a design sprint to help the team come up with the right ideas. 
Our process for continuous delivery allowed us to iterate on this design sprint very quickly.
The design tools we use make it very easy to generate dynamic prototypes like this. 
We have iterated on this for a long time. 
We held an ideation workshop with the entire team last week to find the best possible user experience. 
Our designs are intended to reduce the cognitive load for our users so they can focus on the interface.
We did a competitive analysis and found that our recommendation aligns well with what the market will tolerate.
Our users have a difficult time using this interface, so we re-designed it to be much easier to use.
We found that most of our users do not have a need for this particular feature.
Our focus on both divergent and convergent thinking is what led to this ideal solution. 
This solution is compliant with accessibility standards. 
We designed something that is both useful and delightful to use.
We added an element of delight to every user interaction.
It's important that we not only help the user, but that we also delight them. 
We had a focused effort on interaction design during this sprint.
Creating a good experience is not about what you can add, it's about what you can take away.
We refined our designs by removing everything until there was nothing left to remove.
What we've created is the user experience equivalent of a candy-coated interface. 
We're using many familiar patterns that match with our customer's mental models for how software works. 
In order to understand our decisions, you would have to be familiar with modern design patterns.
We've incorporated many design concepts from Neumorphism in order to make this design work.
The purpose of this interface is to tell a good story to our customers about how the user experience is affected. 
Design is all about good storytelling. 
We've created a series of microinteractions which add value to the user experience in each animation. 
Our designs use a modern card layout to achieve maximum interaction from the user.
We decided to focus heavily on microinteraction design as a method for presenting the user with relevant content. 
User engagement will be improved with this design effort.
We've taken a brutalist approach to our designs during this sprint, which allow for simple solutions. 
To avoid making this look like a template, we're using an asymmetrical layout.
Storytelling is all about transferring data to the users in the best possible informative and creative way.
By applying motion to illustrations we really make our designs stand out and bring them to the life.
Microinteractions are the perfect proof that details and attention to them might greatly improve the overall user experience of our digital products.
We expect our solutions to outperform industry standards. 
We've applied the concepts of simplification and reduction in order achieve a balanced approach to the user experience.
Content is king and the way it gets delivered plays a huge role in the impact it makes.
These designs are so real you can smell it.
We need to be sure we are understanding the scene, the mood, and the repercussions of the actions a user is taking.
We teach our designs to understand context.
Using a reference is the best way to learn new styles and perform diverse techniques.
We've spent countless hours interviewing users to make sure that this solution is correct.
We have leveraged a Lean UX canvas to make sure we're solving the right problem for the business.
The best way to validate our design decisions is to put them in front of real people.
The most innovative companies can achieve designs like this.
The best UX design in the world won't solve all our problems, but this solution is meant to move us in the right direction.
Our lean methodology informs how we create the user experience and you'll love what we've designed.
Most design teams focus on the user interface, but we focus on the customer experience.
In order to understand our design decisions, you need to be aware of the differences between UI, UX, and interaction design.
We've created a platform that can scale with the demands of our business by leveraging the best user experience design.
Our experience with user interface design allows us to design the very best experiences for our customers.
While mapping the user experience, our team uncovered some innovative ways to create the right UX.
All design is storytelling and our UX is intended to tell the very best story for our customers.
While design is subjective, we use a variety of research methods to eliminate bias and create objective UX.
There are lots of ways to create good design decisions, but our team has worked hard to uncover bias in the process.
Using modern behavioral analysis techniques, we have designed a solution that will delight users.
By using collaborative exercises, the designers created a mockup with a vision of a preferred future.
Our designs compose an aesthetic that transcends any modern design patterns we have today.
This UX is going to be disruptive to the industry.
Every disruptive solution requires a solid understand of human-computer interaction design.
By leveraging efficiencies of the UI, our design solution solidifies our understanding of human behavior.
We took a holistic approach to this design sprint by adding personalization to the on-boarding flow.
Creating an engaging experience requires empathy for the user and a deep understanding of the business.
Our designs establish a seamless integration between every platform service we offer to customers.
The cognitive bias inherent in this solution is the key to removing assumptions from the process.
We want to fail fast and fail often so we can deliver on a user experience that modifies user behavior.
Each affordance you'll see in these designs are intentionally designed to create harmony for the user.
Everyone on the team is aligned on the expectations that the user interface is intuitive and overwhelming.
We believe the clarity provided by this design exceeds the customer's expectations for quality and simplicity. 
We provide value through a streamlined interface that simplifies the user journey maps.
Our flexible approach to design workshops affords us more opportunities to lean into design thinking.
This affordance helps our users to complete their task with plenty of time for research.
Personalization is the future of UI design and our UX solutions are simple and elegant.
The architecture of our style guide facilitates the user from developing empathy maps.
Our guidelines for interaction are meant to create transparency in our business.
Our business goals can be accomplished by embracing user behavioral analysis techniques.
We did a user study and found that 90% of customers are delighted by these interactions.
The main reason why our designs are effective is that we superimposed our journey map onto the customer empathy canvas.
Our user experience team is well equipped to handle the challenges of modern platforms.
We ran a design studio exercise to find out if our workshops have yielded the correct UX solutions.
Every time we iterate on these designs, we create multiple opportunities for collaborating on the most effective solution.
By eliminating bias from our process, the design team can focus on reducing cognitive load for the user.
We can humanize the customer experience by creating an empathetic system designed to personalize the experience.
We've designed a high performance system capable of scaling across the chasm of product leadership techniques.
With a cohesive understanding of the user experience, everyone on the team can ideate until completion. 
Every design challenge presents a new opportunity for our company to adapt to a changing marketplace. 
Our designers can create the very best user experiences by implementing user testing models in the wild.
The pace of our progress is seen in the iterative approach and testing methodology we deploy every day. 
This minimalistic interface allows the users to get from point A to point B without friction. 
There is no such thing as failure when we iterate fast and move to mitigate risk. 
Our approachable UI is tailored to each individuals unique needs as a human.
